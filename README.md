# java-rpg
My first substantial programming project. Written with only the basic java libraries. 
Includes simple animations, procedurally generated terrain, inventory management,
infinitely scalable leveling system, save games, texas hold'em minigame and a shopping system.
There are two versions included.

## V1
V1 is older and includes all the functionality.

## V2
In V2 I decided to overhaul the UI which meant that many features had to rewritten.
At the beginning of the project I had very little programming experience, so I implemented
features on the go. This caused problems when trying to change fundamental mechanics.
Soon after that I decided to work on different projects, using my experience to create designs
from the start. Texas hold'em is disabled due to the changes.

## How to play
Run either Gra v2 or v1 jar. You need java installed.  
Controls:  
Arrows or WASD to move  
Space to attack  
ESC to exit buildings (V2)  
C to open inventory screen (V2 only)  
Right-click to equip items (V2 and V1)  
Drag and drop to equip items (V1 only)  
  
To play texas hold'em you need to run V1, get enough money by killing mobs and selling loot
in the shop (building with a coin pouch sign),
and then find enter a tavern (building with a beer mug sign). You can find a town by following the roads.  
AI players are very eager to bluff with bad cards. :)
